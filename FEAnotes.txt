For foot area thing
Split geometry at min point that would be inserted into seat side
Rigid constraint that
Add remote force to wheel contact patch
Choose face that it acts on, then move location of force to wheel contact patch
Define Y component of force for weight, one for x at front collision to wheel
Use distributed if you can (rigid less computing power)
Contact patch is square, that wheel is mounted to, and the four nuts (the inside of the holes)
For the foot thing: make the platform the wheel attaches to one piece with the tubing (combine pieces, add fillet for weld locations)

Upward force: G force based on mass on front wheel
COG + moment balance around wheels to figure out distribution of mass to each wheel
Load Transfer: from certain deceleration (braking load transfer for front wheel sim, prob not care about cornering)
For each hill things, a new mass distribution on wheels (do worst case scenario so downhill + braking all weight on front wheel maybe)
Side wheel prob not need to worry about
Braking not for fatigue limit 
Fatigue, sitting on straight ground mass distribution (maybe safety factor or extra g force for bumps maybe like 1.5G design factor)

If fails maybe new material
Or add new design features
Maybe increase diameter if possible (best gains)
Increase length of place you insert tube
Maybe 1 or maybe 1.5G for crashing
Gs come from wheel compressing in front of you
Look up regulations maybe

Things to Lookup
# of Cycles for Fatigue
S-N Curve for 5052 H38 and 5052-O and maybe 6061 options
G force for normal bumps offroading
G force for running into obstacle


Things I did
- Moved wheel pos 1cm back
- Increased front to back size of wheel plate by 2cm


Notes for Redesign for Kyle
Front U beam
2.5" Width
0.049" wall thickness
Add flanges on elbow
0.5" plate thickness
Make only 1 hole for adjusting
Increase insertion hole for tube to extend as close to elbow as possible
Make sure wheel plate still has clearance (if you move the front wheel holes back then also lengthen the seat area so that the base can be the same size)

I suggest anything with a load path from the body to the wheels should be similar thickness to this part (not necessarily arm-rests or footrest or supporting horizontal)
I also recommend increasing the backrest u beam to be thicker too (maybe not as thick as the front wheel u beam but def thicker than it is now. Prob wont be able to simulate it till after the presentaiton)
The handles might need to increase in thickness by a bit too
prob closer to the 1-1.5" thickness for the above seat back and handles for now


Other notes
- need to add brakes to the frame by the wheels and also the handles
- Maybe make antitip wheel detachable (for 2 sherpa operation)
- The 2 sherpa handles will now need to mount in a much bigger hole from the seat u beam so you will need to figure something out here. The handles should prob be closer to the 1-1.5" thickness tube so either some sort of adapter might be necessary)
- For other tubing the thickness can be similar or even less than the one defined for the front wheel u bar


Good luck, I will be available basically the entire day for any questions you have (I can hop on a call or explain in person)
